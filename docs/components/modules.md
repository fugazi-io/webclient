# Modules

A module aggregates other [components](./components.md) and is considered *local* if it contains 
 only local commands, otherwise it is *remote*.  
A module can be loaded in two ways:
1. As an http GET request for a json descriptor
2. As a script element for a js descriptor

[A detailed description of the module descriptor](../descriptors/module.md).
