### Short example
Fugazi isn't a regular terminal, it won't execute the commands which you are used to.  
In order to execute commands you need to load modules into the client, these modules will define the 
commands which can be executed.

The client comes with a some [built-in commands](./docs/builtins/commands.md), and here's a short 
example of what you can do with it:

In the fugazi terminal try to execute:
```
get "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1"
```
This command will make an http GET request to that url and output the response. 
(you can use other urls of course, as long as they support [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS)).  
If you only want to get the data from the response you can do so like this:
```
r = (get "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1")
extract data from $r 
```
Here we used a variable to hold the response and then extracted the data part from it, 
but you can do it in one line using nested commands:
```
extract data from (get "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1")
```
The only problem left though is that the return value is a string and not a map. 
This happens because the response doesn't have json content type.  
It's easy to go around it though:
```
r = (get "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1")
d = (extract data from $r)
json parse $d
```
Or, in one line:
```
json parse (extract data from (get "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1"))
```

### Installation
The client requires no servers, other than hosting the static files (scripts, styles, etc).  
To run locally install the [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fugazi/webclient):
```bash
npm install @fugazi/webclient
```

Then build the scripts:
```bash
npm run transpile
```

After the compilation ended, serve the files:
```bash
npm run serve
```

That's it, you have fugazi locally served, open [http://localhost:3330/index.hml](http://localhost:3330/index.hml) in your browser.

### Development
If you want to develop with/for fugazi then you better clone this repo.  
Here's how to run it locally:

1. Clone the repo and change into the directory
1. Install the dependencies: `$ npm install`
1. Run `$ npm run dev` (read the `dev` npm script in `package.json` for more information)
1. Open the provided URL in the browser.

### Features
1. Executing of local (js) commands and remote (HTTP) commands
2. Remote commands can be issues directly if the server supports CORS, or a proxy frame can be hosted in the server to support non-CORS
3. Remote authentication (currently only basic auth is supported)
4. Commands syntax is determined by the command author
5. Type validation
6. Composing of new types
7. Commands suggestions
    1. Press `TAB` to open the suggestions box
    2. Press `ESC` to close the suggestion box
    3. While open, `TAB` can be used to switch to _selection mode_ and back to _input mode_
    4. While in _selection mode_, press `ENTER` to select a suggestion
8. Move in the command history (by pressing the up & down arrows)
9. Search for command in history (press `CTRL + R` then start typing and `ENTER` to select, `ESC` to close)
