### Converters
A converter is a javascript function that takes a value of one type and returns a value in another type.  
The client automatically converts the types when needed and if a converter is found to to match the types.

More information about the built-in converters can be found in the [built-on converters docs](https://github.com/fugazi-io/webclient/blob/master/docs/builtins/converters.md).
