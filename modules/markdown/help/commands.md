### Commands
The parameters of a command are validated against the command description, and the result is also validated to match the 
declared return type (for more information about types run `help types`).

In order to run a command you need to write an input that matches the syntax it declared.  
While writing the input you can use the suggestions panel (run `help suggestions` for more info) and if you want to know 
the syntax for a command run `man COMMAND_NAME`, i.e.:
```fugazi-comand
man help
```

For more built-in commands run `man "io.fguazi`.
