### Commands suggestions
You can get help with the syntax for the command you want to run.  
While focused on the input box click `tab` and the suggestions panel will appear.

The suggestions panel will show the syntax of relevant commands that you're writing, and it will change for every key stroke 
you make.  
To hide the panel press `esc`.

#### Completion
You can select one of the suggestions by pressing `tab` again, this will focus on the suggestions panel and you can select 
the command/syntax you want by moving with the up/down arrows and pressing `enter` to select.  
When selecting a command the add completion will only include keywords so it will complete until the next parameter.

You can also select a command using the mouse.  
Pressing `tab` while focused on the suggestions panel will return the focus to the input box.
